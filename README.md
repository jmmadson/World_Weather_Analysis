# World Weather Analysis

## Summary

For this project we were challenged to come up with an application to allow travellers to choose a vacation destination based on their desired weather. We worked with multiple APIs to complete this project including: Open Weather Map, Google Maps, Google Places and Google Destination APIs. 

### Output
We provided three separate deliverables: 
* Deliverable 1: Weather Data - We used the Open Weather API to find the current temperatures for 2000 different locations. We whittled that down to cities near those longitude & latitudes to a list of around 700. 
* Deliverable 2: Vacation Search - From our list of 700 cities that we had data for, we further tweaked the search to take user input of desired minimum and maximum temperatures. From there we created a map showing the user potential vacation options based on their weather preferences. 
* Deliverable 3: Vacation Itinerary - From our list of vacations, we drew up a map with directions for four cities in the Deliverable 2 vacation search.
